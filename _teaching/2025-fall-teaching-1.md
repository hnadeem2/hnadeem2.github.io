BIOE 210 is a core course required for all bioengineering
undergraduates. The goal is to introduce students to essential analytical and computational tools
from linear algebra. In addition to describing vector and matrix arithmetic, students will solve
systems of linear equations and explore linear regression. These methods can be applied to
analyze large, multivariable datasets to quantify relationships between variables; decompose
complex datasets into simpler representations; solve common problems in classification and image
processing; and visualize high-dimensional data spaces. Course topics include definitions of vector
spaces; solvability; rank; basis; linear transformation matrices; and vector & matrix decompositions
(eigenanalysis, SVD, PCA). The course focuses on mathematical and computation aspects of
problem solving, and consequently requires students to access Matlab
