<details> <summary> Abstract </summary> Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Recent structural and biochemical studies have identified key components in the ABA signaling cascade, including PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, protein phosphatases PP2C, and protein kinases SnRK2. Plant-specific Rho-like (ROPs) small GTPases act as negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C, shutting off “leaky” ABA signaling caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis of this negative regulation remains unclear. Here, we employ large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 ms) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations alongside standard protein–protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. We further characterize the complex association pathway and identify critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 that stabilize the complex. This study provides a powerful framework for using large-scale molecular simulations to predict unknown protein complex structures and reveals the molecular mechanism by which small GTPases negatively regulate ABA signal transduction. </details>
