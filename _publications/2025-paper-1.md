<details> <summary> Abstract </summary> Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential plant hormone responsible for plant development and stress responses. Plant-specific Rho-like (ROPs) small GTPases act as negative regulators of ABA signal transduction by interacting with PP2C phosphatases, shutting off “leaky” ABA signaling caused by constitutive activity of monomeric PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors. However, the structural basis for this negative regulation remains unclear. In this study, we utilized large-scale coarse-grained (10.05 ms) and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations along with standard protein–protein binding free energy calculations to predict the complex structure of AtROP11 and phosphatase AtABI1. We also predicted the detailed complex association pathway and identified critical residue pairs in AtROP11 and AtABI1 that stabilize the complex. Overall, this work establishes a computational framework for predicting unknown protein complex structures and provides molecular insight into the negative regulation of ABA signaling by small GTPases. </details>
