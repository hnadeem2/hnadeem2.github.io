I am a Ph.D. student in Bioengineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am a member of the [Shukla group](https://shuklagroup.org/). 

My research is focused on developing novel algorithms for enhanced sampling of biomolecular systems. I have also worked on peptide materials for diverse applications.

Avid fan of [Liverpool FC](https://www.liverpoolfc.com/). Have more experience handling cows, goats and other farm animals than proteins. Always happy to chat (if food is involved).
