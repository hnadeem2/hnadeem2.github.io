I am a Ph.D. student in Biopengineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am a member of the [Shukla group](https://shuklagroup.org/). 

My research is focused on developing novel algorithms for enhanced sampling of biomolecular systems. I have also work on peptide materials for diverse applications.
